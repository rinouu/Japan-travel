### Development questions
1. We have to:
- Make the database
- Choose editor end tools
- Start developing

I will use TailwindCSS, HTML, SublimeText and Ruby on Rails.

3. I will use a HTML form with a uploading zone. And when user click on the submission button, I will create an event in Javascript to create a div element in which i will create some <img> child and diplay the image there. I have to use the function stopPropagation in the function before all of this.
